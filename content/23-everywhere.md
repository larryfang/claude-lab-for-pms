# Claude Where You Already Work

The Cowork window is headquarters. But your actual day happens in Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Slack, and on your phone between meetings — and Claude now works in all of them, with the same skills and connectors you have already set up. This lesson is the map, so you stop copy-pasting between Claude and the tool the work actually lives in.

## The Microsoft 365 add-ins

Claude works **inside** Office — not on exported copies, but on the open file ([announcement](https://claude.com/blog/collaborate-with-claude-across-excel-powerpoint-word-and-outlook)):

| App | Status | What it does on the open file |
|---|---|---|
| **Excel** | GA, all paid plans | Answers with cell-level citations, changes assumptions without breaking formula chains, debugs errors, builds multi-tab models ([guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12650343-use-claude-for-excel)) |
| **PowerPoint** | GA, all paid plans | Builds and restyles decks in your template, on the deck itself |
| **Word** | GA, all paid plans | Drafts and revises in the document, tracked-changes style |
| **Outlook** | Public beta | Inbox triage and drafts — **drafts land unsent, for your review**; calendar invites via the native event form ([guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/14855664-use-claude-for-outlook)) |

Two things make this more than a sidebar gimmick:

- **Your Skills work there.** Type **`/`** in the add-in sidebar and your installed skills appear — `/deck-check` before a QBR, `/variance-pack` in the live workbook — and skills also fire automatically when relevant ([office docs](https://claude.com/docs/office-agents/connectors-and-skills)). The skill you built in Module 8 follows you into Office.
- **One conversation spans the apps.** Context carries across your open Excel, PowerPoint, Word and Outlook files — "use the Q3 numbers from the workbook in slide 4" works.

Google-side there is no equivalent sidebar for Docs/Sheets — the route there is the Drive/Gmail/Calendar connectors from Module 3.

:::warning The reality check: your IT decides, not you
On a company Microsoft 365 tenant, Office add-ins are **admin-controlled** — most organisations block self-install from AppSource, and "Claude for Microsoft 365" reaches you only when IT deploys it centrally (Microsoft 365 admin center → Integrated apps). So this feature needs **two approvals that are often confused**: your Claude plan (the Anthropic side, which you may already have) *and* the add-in deployment (the Microsoft side, which many companies have not done). If typing `/` in Office shows nothing, or the add-in will not install, that is a policy gate — not a bug, and not something to work around with a personal account.

The move is the same one Module 3 taught for a missing connector: **ask IT with a specific job and a specific benefit** — "the close commentary takes finance two days in Excel; the add-in cuts it to hours; here is Anthropic's admin deployment doc" beats "can we have the AI thing". And until the answer is yes, **nothing in this course is blocked**: export the workbook, drop it in your Cowork folder, and every lab works exactly as written — that file-based path is what the four lanes are built on.
:::

:::tip The lane pairings
💼 Sales → **Outlook** (triage + drafted follow-ups you approve) · 📣 GTM → **PowerPoint** (launch decks in your template) · 🧭 Product → **Word** (PRDs revised in place) · 🧾 Finance → **Excel** (this is the surface the finance lane kept pointing at).

## Cowork in your pocket

Cowork runs in beta on **web and mobile** (Pro/Max/Team; Enterprise where enabled), with sessions running in Anthropic's cloud — start a task from your phone, steer it with follow-ups, review the output, resume a session you started elsewhere ([guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15520349-use-claude-cowork-on-web-desktop-and-mobile)).

The honest caveats: **local folders, browser use and computer use** need your desktop app open at home — cloud sessions work from connectors and uploaded files instead. So the pattern that works is:

> **Kick off before the commute, review on the phone.** Start the account-brief run at your desk; approve the plan; read the finished brief on the train. Or start from the phone entirely, as long as the inputs come from connectors, not your laptop's folders.

And for the brief itself: **dictate it**. Mobile dictation is available on all plans ([guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10065434-use-dictation-on-claude-mobile)) — a spoken brief is usually longer and richer than a typed one, and B.R.I.E.F. works just as well out loud.

## Claude in your team's Slack: Claude Tag

The old "Claude in Slack" app was replaced on **2026-08-03** by **Claude Tag** — public beta, **Team and Enterprise plans only**, and admin-provisioned rather than self-serve ([overview](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/overview) · [what is Claude Tag](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15594475-what-is-claude-tag)).

Tag `@Claude` in a channel and hand it actual work: it posts its checklist in the thread, does the job (turn this decision thread into a doc; chase these three owners; investigate this customer report), and follows up on its own. An org Owner sets it up and controls which credentials and resources it can use per channel — so if you want it, this is a request to your admin naming a specific job, exactly like a missing connector in Module 3.

:::concept One account, many doors
Everything in this lesson runs on the same account: the same skills, the same connectors, the same permissions and data rules you set in Module 3. Nothing here is a new trust decision — it is the trust decisions you already made, available where the work is. That is also the argument to your security team: no new data paths, just new doors into the ones you governed.

```quiz
Q: You spend close week inside a 40-tab workbook. Where should Claude meet you?
+ The Claude for Excel add-in — it works on the open workbook with cell-level citations and preserves formula chains
- Export the workbook and upload it to chat every time
- Screenshots of each tab
- Retype the numbers into Cowork
> The add-in works on the live file — where IT has deployed it. Until then, the export-to-Cowork path does the same jobs on a copy.

Q: The `/` menu shows nothing in Excel at work, though your colleague at another company has it. Most likely cause?
+ Your tenant's IT has not deployed the add-in — it is admin-controlled on company M365, so this is a policy request, not a troubleshooting session
- Your Excel is too old
- Skills do not work in Excel
- You need to reinstall Windows
> Two approvals: the Claude plan (Anthropic side) and the add-in deployment (Microsoft side). Ask IT with a specific job, and use file exports meanwhile.

Q: What happens when Claude for Outlook writes an email for you?
+ It lands as an unsent draft for your review — the human send gate stays yours
- It sends immediately
- It only writes subject lines
- It CCs Anthropic
> Drafts, not sends. The same review-before-it-leaves rule the whole course teaches, enforced by the surface.

Q: You start a Cowork task from your phone on the train. What is the key constraint?
+ Cloud sessions work from connectors and uploads — your laptop's local folders need the desktop app open
- Mobile can only read, never start tasks
- Skills don't work on mobile
- There is no constraint
> Mobile Cowork is real, but local-folder and browser work still lives on the desktop.

Q: Your team wants Claude Tag in Slack. What is the correct move?
+ Ask your org admin, naming a specific job — it is Team/Enterprise only and admin-provisioned per channel
- Install it yourself from the Slack app store
- Use a personal account in the channel
- It does not exist
> Admin-gated, like connectors on managed plans. A concrete ask beats a vague one.
