# Lab: Write a Great CLAUDE.md

A strong `CLAUDE.md` pays off every single session. In this lab you'll generate one with `/init`, then do the part most people skip: **prune and tune it** until Claude's behavior actually changes.

## Part 1 — Simulator: init → prune → tune

Work through this guided flow, then do it for real on your own repo.

```claude-sim
# A real project is open. Let's build its memory file.
> /init
Analyzing the project… detected: TypeScript, pnpm, Vitest, Express, Prisma.
Created CLAUDE.md (1 file, 86 lines) with: project overview, commands,
detected conventions, and a file map of src/.
Open it to review — I tend to over-include on the first pass.
> that's too long. cut anything I could figure out by reading the code, and drop the per-file map. keep commands, real conventions, and gotchas.
Revised CLAUDE.md → 31 lines. Removed: the src/ file map, generic "use TypeScript"
advice, and restated language defaults. Kept: pnpm commands, the Vitest single-file
tip, the Prisma migrate gotcha, and required env vars.
> add a rule: never edit files under src/generated, and always run `pnpm typecheck` after a batch of edits. mark them important.
Updated CLAUDE.md. Added under ## Workflow:
  - IMPORTANT: never edit src/generated/** (built by `pnpm codegen`)
  - IMPORTANT: run `pnpm typecheck` after a series of edits
> now make a trivial change to a generated file to prove the rule holds
I won't — src/generated/** is off-limits per CLAUDE.md. If you need that output
changed, edit the source schema and run `pnpm codegen`. Want me to do that instead?
```

:::tip What just happened
You watched the full lifecycle: **generate → prune hard → add sharp rules → verify the behavior changed.** That last step — Claude *refusing* to touch `src/generated` — is how you know a rule landed. If behavior doesn't change, the rule is buried or ambiguous.

## Part 2 — Do it on your own repo

:::lab Build & tune your CLAUDE.md
**Generate the draft:**

```bash
cd path/to/your-project
claude
```
Then at the prompt:

```prompt
/init
```

- [ ] `/init` created a starter `CLAUDE.md`

**Prune it ruthlessly** (paste this):

```prompt
Review CLAUDE.md and cut it down. Remove anything you could infer by reading the code, any restated language defaults, and any per-file descriptions. Keep only: non-obvious commands, conventions that differ from defaults, repo etiquette, and real gotchas. Show me the before/after line counts.
```

- [ ] My `CLAUDE.md` is meaningfully shorter (aim < ~200 lines)

**Add 2–3 sharp, project-specific rules** (adapt):

```prompt
Add these rules with IMPORTANT emphasis: (1) the exact test command and that you prefer single-file test runs, (2) one directory you must never edit, (3) one gotcha that's bitten us. Then show me the final file.
```

- [ ] My rules are specific and emphasized

**Test that a rule actually changed behavior:**

```prompt
Without making changes yet, tell me: based on CLAUDE.md, what will you do differently in this project compared to a generic one? Name the specific rules you'll follow.
```

- [ ] Claude echoed back my real rules (proof they're loaded and clear)

**Commit it so your team benefits:**

```prompt
Commit CLAUDE.md with a clear message.
```

- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` is committed

:::warning Keep tending it
`CLAUDE.md` is living. When Claude does something annoying, add a rule. When a rule stops being needed, delete it. When Claude ignores a rule, the file's probably too long — prune. Review it like code.
:::

```quiz
Q: How do you know a CLAUDE.md rule actually "landed"?
+ Claude's behavior visibly changes (e.g., it refuses to edit a forbidden directory)
- The file got longer
- You feel good about it
- It's impossible to know
> Test by observation. If behavior doesn't shift, the rule is buried (file too long) or ambiguous (reword it).

Q: After /init generates a CLAUDE.md, the most important next step is to…
+ Prune it — cut anything Claude could infer from the code
- Add 200 more lines
- Leave it exactly as generated
- Delete it
> /init over-includes by design. The value is in pruning to the essentials and tuning over time.
