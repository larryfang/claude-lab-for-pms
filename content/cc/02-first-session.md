# Lab: Your First Session

Time to drive. First you'll run a guided session in the **in-browser terminal** below, then do the same in your own Claude Code. The whole point: feel the *ask → review → steer → verify* loop.

:::concept What you'll practice
1. **Ask** a codebase question (orientation)
2. **Make** a tiny, safe change
3. **Verify** it with a test or build
4. **Commit** it

That's the atomic unit of working with Claude Code. Everything scales up from here.

## Part 1 — The simulator

Work through this guided session. Type each suggested command exactly and press **Enter**, or leave the field blank and choose **Run ▶**. This guided transcript checks each expected step before showing the canned response. Hit **↻ Reset** to replay.

```claude-sim
# A tiny Node project is open. You launched Claude Code in it.
$ cd todo-api && claude
Claude Code — ready. Working directory: ~/code/todo-api
Type a request, or /help. Tip: press Shift+Tab to switch modes.
> what does this project do and what's the test command?
I read package.json, README.md, and src/. Summary:
  • todo-api — a small Express REST API for todos (src/server.js, src/todos.js)
  • Storage is in-memory (src/store.js)
  • Test command: npm test  (uses Jest; tests in __tests__/)
The README mentions GET/POST /todos but there's no health check endpoint.
> add a GET /health endpoint that returns { status: "ok" }. write a test for it, then run the tests.
Plan:
  1. Add GET /health to src/server.js returning { status: "ok" }
  2. Add __tests__/health.test.js hitting the route with supertest
  3. Run npm test
Proceed? (I'll edit 2 files.)
> yes
✎ Edited src/server.js  (+4)
✎ Created __tests__/health.test.js  (+12)
  $ npm test
 PASS  __tests__/todos.test.js
 PASS  __tests__/health.test.js
Tests: 7 passed, 7 total ✓
The new endpoint works and all tests pass. Want me to commit?
> commit with a clear message
  $ git add -A && git commit -m "feat: add GET /health endpoint with test"
[main 9c1f2a0] feat: add GET /health endpoint with test
 2 files changed, 16 insertions(+)
Done. Anything else?
```

:::tip Notice the loop
You **asked** (orientation), **described an outcome** (Claude proposed a plan and asked before editing), it **verified** with the test suite and showed the passing output as evidence, then **committed**. That evidence-first habit — showing the test output, not just claiming success — is what lets you trust unattended work.
:::

## Part 2 — Now do it for real

Pick any small project you have (or `git clone` a tiny repo). Then run these in your **own terminal** — copy each, paste, and go.

:::lab Run your first real session
**Start Claude in your project:**

```bash
cd path/to/your-project
claude
```

- [ ] Claude Code started in my project

**Ask it to orient you** (type this at the prompt):

```prompt
Give me a 5-bullet overview of this project: what it does, the main entry point, how to run it, how to test it, and one thing that looks unfinished or risky.
```

- [ ] I got a useful overview of my own codebase

**Make a tiny, safe change** (adapt to your project):

```prompt
Add a single log line at startup that prints the app version from package.json. Show me the change before applying it.
```

- [ ] Claude proposed the change and I approved it

**Verify it** (use your real run/test command):

```prompt
Run the project (or the tests) and show me the output to prove it still works.
```

- [ ] I saw real output confirming it works

**Commit it:**

```prompt
Commit this change with a clear, conventional commit message.
```

- [ ] The change is committed
:::

:::warning If Claude asks permission
In normal mode, Claude asks before editing files or running commands. **Read the request, then approve.** That's the safety model working — you stay in control. (We'll tune this in the Permissions lesson so you're not clicking forever.)
:::

## Reflect

You just ran the core loop on your own code. Two habits to carry forward from this single lab:

1. **Ask before you assume.** Orientation questions are free and prevent wrong-problem solutions.
2. **Always close the loop with verification.** "Show me it works" beats "it works."

```quiz
Q: In the session, why did Claude show the `npm test` output instead of just saying "done"?
+ Evidence beats assertion — showing passing tests lets you trust the work without re-checking it yourself
- To use more tokens
- It's required by git
- To look impressive
> "Show me it works" is the habit that makes unattended runs trustworthy. Always give Claude a way to verify and ask it to show the result.

Q: What's the atomic loop you practiced?
+ Ask (orient) → make a change → verify → commit
- Type code → hope → ship
- Clear → model → exit
- Plan → plan → plan
> Orientation, a small change, verification, and a commit. Every bigger workflow is built from this unit.
```

That's Foundations. Mark it done for your **🐣 Booted Up** badge. Next module is the real skill ceiling: **context engineering** — feeding Claude exactly what it needs and nothing it doesn't.
