# Subagents

A **subagent** is a specialist Claude can delegate to — running in its **own context window**, with its **own tools and system prompt**, returning only a **summary** to your main session. They're the single best tool for protecting context (remember: context is everything).

## Why they matter

When Claude researches a codebase or reviews a big diff, it reads lots of files — all of which would normally pile into *your* context. A subagent does that work **in a separate window** and hands back a distilled result:

```text
   main session ──"investigate X"──▶  subagent (fresh context)
        ▲                                  │ reads 20 files,
        └────────  summary only  ◀─────────┘ returns 5 bullets
```

Your main conversation stays lean and focused on building.

## Defining one

A subagent is a Markdown file in `.claude/agents/` (project) or `~/.claude/agents/` (personal), with frontmatter + a system prompt:

```markdown
<!-- .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md -->
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews a diff for bugs, security, and convention violations. Use after implementing a change.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---
You are a senior reviewer. Flag actual bugs, security issues, and convention
violations — not style nitpicks. For each finding, give the file:line and a
specific suggested fix. Report only issues that affect correctness or the stated
requirements. If the diff is clean, say so.
```

Key frontmatter ([sub-agents reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)):
- **`name`** / **`description`** — the description is how Claude decides when to delegate.
- **`tools`** — restrict what it can do (a reviewer needs Read/Grep/Bash, not Write).
- **`model`** — e.g. `haiku` for fast read-only research, `opus` for hard reasoning.
- **`memory`** — give the subagent its **own persistent memory** across sessions (subagents don't share the main session's auto memory), loaded before it starts and written back after ([@lydiahallie, 2026-07-20](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2079255826355892464)).

Manage them with **`/agents`**. Subagents spawned mid-session run **in the background by default**, so your conversation keeps moving while they work.

## Invoke them — by name or on purpose

Claude auto-delegates when relevant, or you can be explicit:

```prompt
Use a subagent to investigate how token refresh works and whether we have OAuth utilities to reuse. Summarize with file references.
```
```prompt
Use the code-reviewer subagent on my current diff.
```

Two related commands round out delegation ([commands reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/commands)):

- **`/subtask`** — hand a side task to a subagent; the result comes back into *this* conversation.
- **`/fork`** — copy the whole conversation into a **new background session** that inherits everything you've discussed, then keep working here. Perfect for "also try the other approach while I continue."

## The built-ins: Explore & Plan

Claude Code ships with subagents it invokes automatically:

| Built-in | Role |
|---|---|
| **Explore** | Fast, **read-only** codebase research (often on Haiku) — used to gather context for a plan |
| **Plan** | Does the research during plan mode so your main agent stays focused on presenting the plan |

:::warning Don't shadow the built-ins
Don't name a custom subagent `Explore` or `Plan` — you'll override the built-ins and break plan mode in subtle ways.
:::

## Two rules that make subagents great

:::concept Specific beats general
A **feature-specific** subagent (`payment-flow-reviewer`, `migration-explorer`) outperforms a vague one (`qa`, `backend-engineer`). Specificity buys better tool selection and tighter context.
:::

:::warning Subagents don't inherit CLAUDE.md
A subagent starts with **only** its own system prompt (the built-in Explore/Plan deliberately skip CLAUDE.md and git status to stay lean). So if a subagent needs a project rule, **embed it in the subagent's prompt** — don't assume it read `CLAUDE.md`.

## See it delegate

```claude-sim
# You just implemented a change and want a fresh-eyes review.
> use the code-reviewer subagent on my current diff
Delegating to code-reviewer (separate context, tools: Read/Grep/Bash)…
code-reviewer report:
  • src/auth/oauth.ts:41 — state param isn't validated on callback (CSRF risk). Fix: compare against the stored state before exchanging the code.
  • src/auth/oauth.ts:58 — error path leaks the raw provider response in the 500 body. Fix: log it, return a generic message.
  • Tests: callback happy-path covered; no test for denied consent.
Two correctness issues + one test gap. Want me to fix all three?
> fix the CSRF and error-leak issues, add the denied-consent test, then re-review
```

```quiz
Q: What's the #1 reason to use a subagent?
+ It runs in a separate context window and returns only a summary, keeping your main context clean
- It's a different AI model from a different company
- It edits files twice as fast
- It removes the need for tests
> Investigation/review reads lots of files. Subagents quarantine that token cost and report back a distilled result.

Q: Your reviewer subagent ignores a project rule that's in CLAUDE.md. Why?
+ Subagents don't inherit CLAUDE.md — embed needed rules directly in the subagent's prompt
- CLAUDE.md is broken
- Subagents can't read rules at all
- You must restart Claude
> Subagents start with only their own system prompt. Put any rule they must follow into that prompt.

Q: Which subagent design is better?
+ A specific one like "payment-flow-reviewer" with a tight toolset
- A vague catch-all "engineer" that does everything
- Naming it "Plan" to reuse the built-in
- One giant agent with all tools enabled
> Specificity buys better tool selection and tighter context. And never shadow the built-in Explore/Plan names.

Commands and subagents are *advisory* — Claude chooses when to use them. **Hooks** are different: they run automatically, every time, guaranteed.
