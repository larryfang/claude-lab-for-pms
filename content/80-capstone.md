# Capstone: The Revenue Review Machine

Forty minutes. One end-to-end build that uses every piece of this course: connectors, a Skill, a fan-out, a verification pass, and a schedule.

At the end you will have something that runs on Monday whether you remember it or not.

:::concept What you are building
A **review machine** for your lane: a repeatable, scheduled job that pulls from your real systems, produces a data artefact and a narrative artefact, flags what needs a human, and reports its own health.

Not a one-off deliverable. A thing that keeps producing.
:::

## Choose your build

:::details 💼 Sales — the Monday pipeline machine
**Produces:** a hygiene delta report, a forecast model, a two-page deal review, and a brief per at-risk account.

**Sources:** CRM, email, your notes folder.

**Cadence:** Monday 8am, into a draft folder.
:::

:::details 📣 GTM — the weekly market and funnel machine
**Produces:** a competitive-change digest with citations, a funnel model, a campaign readout, and a flag list of messaging claims that have gone stale.

**Sources:** campaign data, competitor pages (Chrome), CRM.

**Cadence:** Monday 8am, into a draft folder.
:::

:::details 🧭 Product — the weekly evidence and update machine
**Produces:** a tracker reality check, three audience-specific updates, a backlog-evidence table, and a loop-closing list.

**Sources:** Jira or Linear, support tickets, feedback records.

**Cadence:** Monday 8am, into a draft folder.
:::

## Stage 1 — Foundation (8 min)

:::lab Build the Project
- [ ] Create a Cowork **Project** for this work
- [ ] Write its instructions: who you are, what you sell or build, your definitions (weightings, thresholds, taxonomies, currency), your **unreliable fields list**, standing rules, and your tone preferences
- [ ] Grant the workspace folder with subfolders: `sources/`, `reference/`, `output/weekly/`, `snapshots/`
- [ ] Connect the systems you need and run a **read-only smoke test** on each — a query whose answer you already know
- [ ] Record everything in `ACCESS-LOG.md`
:::

- [ ] Every connector returns data that matches the real system
- [ ] The Project instructions contain my actual definitions, not placeholders

:::warning Do not proceed on a failed smoke test
If any connector returns numbers that do not match its source system, fix that first. Everything above it inherits the error, and a scheduled job will inherit it silently, every week.
:::

## Stage 2 — The ground-truth pass (8 min)

Always the first stage of the chain. Data quality before analysis.

:::lab Build stage 2
Write and run a brief that produces `output/weekly/reality-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

- [ ] The exact query run: systems, filters, date range, records matched, records returned
- [ ] Every data quality problem, itemised with its record ID
- [ ] Every record excluded from downstream analysis, and why
- [ ] A trust score out of 10 with reasoning
- [ ] A status line at the top: date, record counts, and OK or PROBLEM

Rules to include: never estimate a missing value; do not drop a record without flagging it; row count out must equal row count in and both must be stated.
:::

- [ ] It found problems I did not know about
- [ ] The status line is glanceable

## Stage 3 — The model (8 min)

:::lab Build stage 3
Produce a spreadsheet in `output/weekly/` with:

- [ ] A **Data** tab: the cleaned records, header frozen
- [ ] A **Model** tab: your calculations as **live formulas**, with assumptions in labelled editable cells
- [ ] A **Sample size column** next to every ranking or comparison
- [ ] An **Excluded** tab: every record not in the model, why, and the total value those records represent
:::

- [ ] I changed an assumption and the totals moved
- [ ] The Excluded tab tells me how much is unexplained
- [ ] Every ranking shows its sample size

## Stage 4 — The narrative (8 min)

:::lab Build stage 4
Produce your review document in `output/weekly/`. Two pages maximum, and it must include:

- [ ] A headline: one sentence, the honest state of things
- [ ] The numbers, in a compact table, each traceable to the model
- [ ] What needs attention, with the specific evidence for each item
- [ ] What is going well, with the evidence
- [ ] **What I need** — decisions, resources, air cover, stated as requests
- [ ] **What this cannot tell you** — the honest limits
- [ ] A paste-ready summary of four sentences
- [ ] A flag section: anything needing a human before this is used

Rules: every claim cites the model; every ranking states its sample size; never describe stalled or missing data as healthy; two pages maximum.
:::

- [ ] Two pages, and I would actually send it
- [ ] Every claim traces to the model

## Stage 5 — The fan-out (4 min)

:::lab Build stage 5
One file per item that needs individual attention — per at-risk deal, per competitor change, per stalled epic.

- [ ] Identical structure in every file
- [ ] An `_index.md` comparison table
- [ ] A final consolidation pass across the set, listing what was normalised
- [ ] Tested on **two** items before running on all of them
:::

## Stage 6 — Skill it (2 min)

:::lab Package the chain
- [ ] Turn the whole four-stage chain into one `SKILL.md`
- [ ] Its definitions section holds your company specifics
- [ ] Its rules section holds every correction you made during this build
- [ ] Description lists every phrasing that should trigger it
- [ ] **Cold test**: ask in natural language, without pasting anything. Does it fire and produce all four artefacts?
:::

## Stage 7 — Schedule it (2 min)

:::lab Go unattended
- [ ] Add the explicit failure path: *"If any source is unreachable or returns zero records, still write the file, put PROBLEM in the status line, state exactly what failed, and write nothing else. Never write a normal-looking report from missing data."*
- [ ] Add the delta instruction: compare against last week's file and report only what changed
- [ ] Add the empty case: *"If nothing needs attention, say so in one line and stop."*
- [ ] Confirm it is **read-only** on every source system and writes only its own report file
- [ ] Move the job into a **Project** and point its output at the Project's files — scheduled tasks run remotely against connectors and files in your Claude account, and **cannot reach a local folder** like `output/weekly/`
- [ ] Schedule it for Monday 8am
- [ ] Run it **manually** once more and read the whole output
:::

:::warning You have run this by hand once
The rule from Module 7 says three times before you trust a schedule. Keep it scheduled, but read the next three outputs properly — trace numbers, check counts, read the flags. After three clean runs it has earned your inattention.
:::

## Stage 8 — Verify and hand over (final)

:::lab The four-check pass
- [ ] Traced three random numbers to source
- [ ] Row count in equals row count out
- [ ] Three quotes or external claims checked at source
- [ ] Read every flag and resolved it
- [ ] Every unverifiable number removed or marked
- [ ] I can explain every conclusion in my own words
:::

:::lab The handover
Generate `output/HANDOVER.md` covering: what this does, the Skill and its trigger phrases, the Project instructions and why each definition matters, the connectors and their smoke tests, three example requests, the known limitations, and what to review quarterly.

- [ ] Written, read, and corrected where it was wrong
- [ ] Given to one colleague who ran it without me
:::

## You are done

Look at what you built. Every concept in this course is in there:

| Module | Where it appears |
|---|---|
| The brief | Every stage's instructions |
| Deliverables | The spreadsheet with live formulas and the two-page narrative |
| Steering | The plan review at each stage |
| Connectors | Stage 1, with smoke tests and an access log |
| Your lane's play | Stages 2–5 |
| Skills | Stage 6, cold-tested |
| Schedules | Stage 7, with a failure path and delta reporting |
| Projects | Stage 1, holding your definitions |
| Verification | Stage 8, as a habit |
| Rollout | The handover |

:::concept What you actually learned
Not a tool. A way of delegating: describe the outcome precisely, name the sources, set the rules, ask to be told what you should decide, then verify before you trust.

That transfers to every agentic tool you will use, and to every person you will ever brief.
