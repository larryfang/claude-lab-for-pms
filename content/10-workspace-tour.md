# The Cowork Workspace

Seven things on the screen. Know what each one is for and nothing about a Cowork run will surprise you.

:::note A fast-moving product
Cowork ships fast, so labels and layout move. This lesson teaches you what to **look for**, not where to click. If your screen differs, find the thing that does this job.
:::

## 1 — The workspace folder

The folder (or folders) you grant. Cowork reads and writes here. This is its whole world.

**What to look for:** a folder picker, a workspace name, or a path shown near the top.

**The thing people get wrong:** granting too much. A folder is not a suggestion — it is a permission boundary. Grant `Q3-launch/`, not `Documents/`.

## 2 — The task box

Where you describe the outcome. Not a chat line — a brief. It can be long. Longer is usually better.

**The thing people get wrong:** treating it like a chat box and typing eight words. Module 2's whole subject.

## 3 — The plan

Cowork typically shows you the steps it intends to take before or as it starts. This is your cheapest intervention point: fixing a wrong plan costs a sentence, fixing a wrong deliverable costs a re-run.

**What to look for:** a numbered list of steps, a "plan" or "todo" panel, or steps that tick off as it works.

:::tip Read the plan properly
Not the vibe of the plan — the actual steps. You are looking for three things: **a source it should not be reading**, **a step that writes where you did not expect**, and **a missing step** — the check, the cross-reference, the "flag what is missing" that you asked for and it quietly dropped.

## 4 — The activity feed

The running log of what it is doing: files opened, commands run, connectors queried, files written. Scroll it when something looks wrong. It is also where you notice a job has been reading the same file forty times because your brief was ambiguous.

## 5 — Subagents

For bigger jobs Cowork splits work across parallel workers — one researching each account, one writing the summary. Mostly automatic; you just get the speed.

**Where it matters to you:** parallel workers do not share what they learn mid-run. Twelve account briefs written by twelve subagents can be individually good and collectively inconsistent. If cross-consistency matters, say so: *"After the individual briefs, review all twelve together and make the scoring consistent."*

## 6 — Scheduled tasks

Save a job, have it run on a cadence — every Monday 8am, every weekday at 6pm. Chat cannot do this. Scheduled tasks run remotely, so they run on time even when your computer is asleep or the app is closed.

**Where it matters to you:** a scheduled job runs with **no one reading the plan**. Only schedule jobs that are read-only or write to a scratch folder, and that you have run by hand successfully at least three times. Module 8.

## 7 — Projects

A persistent workspace for recurring work: its own files, links, instructions and memory. Open it next month and Claude already knows the context — your naming conventions, your ICP definition, last quarter's numbers.

**Where it matters to you:** this is how you stop re-explaining your business every single run.

## And one thing that is not on screen: connectors

Connectors (Jira, Salesforce, HubSpot, Gmail, Slack, Drive) are configured under **Customize → Connectors**, but they are what turns Cowork from "a very good file assistant" into something that knows your pipeline. Module 3.

## Scavenger hunt

Open Cowork and find each of these. Tick as you go:

- [ ] Where you **choose or change the workspace folder**
- [ ] The **task box**
- [ ] Where the **plan / steps** appear
- [ ] The **activity feed** of what it is doing
- [ ] Where **scheduled tasks** are created or listed
- [ ] **Projects**
- [ ] The **stop / interrupt** control — find this one before you need it
- [ ] **Settings → Connectors**

:::warning Find the stop button now
Not when a run is halfway through moving your files. Now. Every experienced Cowork user has needed it, and the ones who knew where it was lost thirty seconds instead of a folder.

## How the pieces fit together

Everything in this course lives somewhere on that list:

- **Connectors** give Cowork access to your systems
- **Skills** teach it your formats and rules
- **Projects** give recurring work persistent memory
- **Subagents** are Cowork parallelising a big job
- **Schedules** remove you from the loop entirely
- **The plan and the stop button** are how you stay in control while all of that happens

```quiz
Q: What is the cheapest point at which to correct a Cowork run?
- After reading the final deliverable
+ While reading the plan, before it acts
- Halfway through, using the stop button
- On the second re-run
> A wrong plan costs one sentence to fix. A wrong deliverable costs a whole re-run.

Q: Twelve account briefs produced by parallel subagents come back individually excellent but scored inconsistently. Why?
- The model degraded
+ Parallel subagents do not share context mid-run — you have to ask for a consolidation pass
- The connector timed out
- Too many files
> Ask for a final review pass across all outputs whenever cross-consistency matters.

Q: What is the special risk of a scheduled task?
- It costs more
+ It runs with nobody reading the plan, so a brief that is slightly wrong repeats that error unattended
- It cannot use connectors
- It only runs once
> Schedule only jobs that are read-only or write to scratch, and only after several successful manual runs.

Q: What is the purpose of a Project in Cowork?
- To store billing information
+ A persistent workspace with its own files, instructions and memory, so recurring work does not need re-explaining
- To share output publicly
- To pick a different model
> Projects are how you stop describing your business from scratch every run.
