# Lab: Battlecard from Live Sources

Twenty minutes. A competitor battlecard with a citation on every claim, then an adversarial pass that tries to break it.

The second half is the point. A battlecard is repeated out loud to the person best placed to contradict it, so an unverified battlecard is worse than no battlecard.

:::note Setup
Ideal: **Claude in Chrome** connected, on a dedicated profile, granted only on the sites you will research (Module 3).

Without it: save the competitor's pricing page, homepage and docs pages as text into your workspace folder and point the brief at those files. The practice `gtm/competitor-*.txt` files from Module 1 also work.
:::

## Part 1 — Research, with sourcing enforced (8 min)

:::lab Step 1 — The research pass
Note that this brief does **not** ask for a battlecard yet. Research first, synthesis second — because mixing them is how unsourced claims get laundered into confident copy.

```prompt
BACKGROUND. I am a PMM at [COMPANY]. We lose deals to [COMPETITOR] and I need to understand them accurately before I write anything our reps will say out loud.

RESULT. `output/[competitor]-research.md` with these sections. In every section, structure each item as OBSERVED (what the source says, with the URL or filename and the date) then INFERRED (my reading of it, explicitly labelled).

1. WHAT THEY SELL — products, packaging, what is in which tier
2. PRICING — every price, unit and tier you can actually see on a page. If pricing is not public, write "not public" and say what you could determine
3. POSITIONING — their own words on who they are for and what they claim to be better at. Quote them
4. RECENT CHANGES — anything that has visibly changed in the last six months, with dates
5. WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS SAY PUBLICLY — themes from review sites and forums, with a quote and link each. Both positive and negative
6. WHAT THEIR DOCUMENTATION REVEALS — limits, requirements, missing features that marketing does not mention
7. WHERE MARKETING AND DOCS DISAGREE — anything their own materials contradict
8. WHAT I COULD NOT FIND OUT — explicitly

INPUTS. Only pages you actually visit on their own domains, their docs site, their status page, and public review sites — or only the files I have given you. Do not use the model's general knowledge of this company. Do not visit anything behind a login.

EDGES. Every factual claim needs a URL and the date read, or a filename. If you cannot source it, leave it out — do not fill gaps from general knowledge. Never state a price you did not see on a page. Never describe a feature you did not see documented. Read-only: do not click anything that submits, signs up, purchases or contacts them, and do not fill in any form.

FLAG: anything that looks like it changed recently; anything where two of their own sources disagree; anything a rep should verify with a human before repeating.

Show me your plan and the exact list of URLs you intend to visit before you start.
```

- [ ] I reviewed the URL list before it went
- [ ] Every claim has a URL or filename and a date
- [ ] Section 8 is populated — it should never be empty
- [ ] OBSERVED and INFERRED are visibly separated
:::

:::tip Save the sources
Have Cowork save the page text it read into `snapshots/[competitor]/[date]/`. In six weeks the pages will have changed and you will need to know what they actually said. This is also what makes the monitoring play in Module 7 possible — you cannot diff against a snapshot you did not keep.
:::

## Part 2 — The battlecard (6 min)

:::lab Step 2 — Synthesis, from the research only
```prompt
BACKGROUND. Reps have 90 seconds to read this before a call. They need things they can say out loud without being contradicted.

RESULT. `output/battlecard-[competitor].md`, ONE page maximum:

1. IN ONE LINE — who they are and when we lose to them
2. WHERE WE WIN — three points. Each with the proof, the source, and the exact words a rep should use
3. WHERE THEY WIN — three points, stated honestly, each with what a rep should say instead of arguing
4. THEIR LIKELY ATTACK — the three things they will say about us, and the true response to each
5. TRAP QUESTIONS — three questions a rep can ask that favour us and are fair
6. DISQUALIFIERS — when we should walk away from this deal
7. DO NOT SAY — claims that are unverified, stale, or that legal would not want repeated
8. SOURCES AND FRESHNESS — every claim keyed to its source and date, plus a "check again after" date

INPUTS. Only `output/[competitor]-research.md`. Nothing else — do not add anything from general knowledge.

EDGES. Every claim in sections 2–5 must trace to a sourced item in the research file. If the research does not support a point, write "[NO EVIDENCE]" rather than filling it. Never state their price unless the research has a URL for it. Section 3 must be genuinely honest — if you cannot name three real places they beat us, name what you can and say so.

FLAG: any claim resting on a source over three months old; anything you had to mark [NO EVIDENCE].
```

- [ ] One page, and readable in 90 seconds
- [ ] Section 3 (where they win) is honest, not token
- [ ] Section 7 exists and is specific
- [ ] Every claim keys to a source
:::

:::warning Section 3 is the credibility test
If "where they win" is three soft non-answers, the battlecard is marketing rather than enablement — and reps will stop trusting it after the first call where the competitor demonstrably did something better.

Push back:

> "Section 3 is soft. Using only the research file — their documentation, their review-site praise, and the places our own materials go quiet — name three things they genuinely do better than us. If the evidence only supports two, give me two and say so."
:::

## Part 3 — The adversarial pass (6 min)

This is the half that makes the difference.

:::lab Step 3 — Break your own battlecard
```prompt
You are now [COMPETITOR]'s competitive lead, and you have obtained this battlecard. Produce `output/battlecard-attack.md`:

1. Every claim about you that is factually wrong or out of date. For each, quote the battlecard, state what is actually true, and cite the source
2. Every claim that is technically true but misleading in context — and how you would reframe it in front of a prospect
3. The single claim you would most enjoy a rep saying to a customer of yours, because of how you would respond
4. Where their honest "where they win" section understates you
5. The claim that would most damage their credibility if a prospect fact-checked it live on the call

Use only the research file and the sources cited in the battlecard. Be specific and quote directly.
```

- [ ] It found at least one real problem
- [ ] I fixed the battlecard
:::

:::lab Step 4 — Final safety check
```prompt
Final pass. Go through the battlecard and, for every claim, tell me: (a) can a rep verify this in under a minute if challenged, (b) is the source under three months old, (c) is this a factual statement or an opinion, and (d) would our legal team be comfortable with a rep saying this to a customer.

Move anything that fails (a), (b) or (d) into the DO NOT SAY section. Then tell me what proportion of the battlecard survived, and mark the whole document with today's date and a review-by date three months out.
```

- [ ] The battlecard has a date and a review-by date
- [ ] Everything unverifiable moved to DO NOT SAY
- [ ] I know what proportion survived
:::

:::tip The survival rate is your quality signal
A first-pass battlecard typically loses 20–40% of its claims to this filter. That is a healthy number and exactly what you want to discover before a rep is on a call, not after.

If nothing failed the filter, the filter was not applied honestly. Re-run it and be harsher.
:::

## Part 4 — Keep it alive

A battlecard's real failure mode is going stale silently. Someone reads a six-month-old price out loud.

- [ ] Every claim carries its source date
- [ ] The document has a review-by date on it
- [ ] Snapshots of the source pages are saved
- [ ] Module 7 puts the monitoring on a schedule so you learn when their pricing page changes

```quiz
Q: Why separate the research pass from the battlecard pass?
- To produce more files
+ Mixing them lets unsourced claims get laundered into confident copy — research first forces every claim to have a source before it becomes something a rep says
- Because research takes longer
- To use fewer tokens
> Two passes, one direction of dependency. The battlecard can only use what the research sourced.

Q: The "where they win" section came back with three soft non-answers. What is the consequence?
- The document is shorter
+ Reps stop trusting the battlecard after the first call where the competitor demonstrably did something better
- Legal will reject it
- Nothing; that section is optional
> An enablement document that only flatters you is marketing, and reps can tell.

Q: What does OBSERVED / INFERRED labelling in the research file achieve?
- Better formatting
+ It keeps what a page actually said separate from the researcher's reading of it, so inference cannot be repeated as fact
- It shortens the document
- It is required by review sites
> The two get merged silently otherwise, and inference is what gets contradicted on calls.

Q: Your safety filter rejected nothing at all. What is the most likely explanation?
- The battlecard is excellent
+ The filter was not applied honestly — a healthy first pass typically loses 20–40% of its claims
- The research was too narrow
- The competitor has no public information
> Re-run it and be harsher. Discovering this before a rep is on a call is the entire value.
