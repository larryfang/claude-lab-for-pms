# Lab: Campaign Readout & Funnel Story

Twenty minutes. Messy channel data goes in. A funnel model, an honest readout, and a list of the things this data genuinely cannot tell you comes out.

The last part is what makes it credible.

:::note Data
Use a real campaign export if you have one, or the practice `gtm/campaign-performance.csv` from Module 1. Real data is better — yours has more interesting problems.
:::

## Part 1 — Integrity before insight (7 min)

:::lab Step 1 — The data integrity pass
```prompt
BACKGROUND. I am a growth PMM. Our CMO does not trust marketing dashboards because the numbers never reconcile with the CRM. Before I analyse anything, I need to know exactly what is wrong with this data.

RESULT. Two files in `output/`:

`campaign-clean.csv` — every original row, plus:
- channel_normalised, with every variant mapped
- date_clean as YYYY-MM-DD
- ctr, cost_per_click, cost_per_mql, mql_to_sql_rate, sql_to_opp_rate, cost_per_opp
- data_quality_flags — a semicolon-separated list of every problem with this row

`data-integrity.md`:
1. Row count in, row count out. If they differ, explain exactly why
2. Every channel-name variant found and what you mapped it to
3. Every row where a rate cannot be computed (zero denominator) and how you marked it
4. Every row with spend but no clicks, or clicks but no spend — these are usually tracking failures, list them all
5. Every row with a funnel impossibility: more SQLs than MQLs, more opportunities than SQLs, negative values
6. Every duplicate or near-duplicate row
7. Date coverage: the actual range, and any gaps
8. A trust score out of 10 for this dataset, with reasoning

INPUTS. Only the campaign data file.

EDGES. Do not drop a single row — flag it. Never compute a rate from a zero denominator; mark it "n/a". Never estimate a missing spend or conversion figure. Write only to `output/`.

FLAG: anything that looks like a tracking or attribution failure rather than a genuine zero.

Show me your plan first.
```

- [ ] Row counts match
- [ ] It found funnel impossibilities or tracking failures
- [ ] The trust score is justified
:::

:::tip Section 5 is where the real problems live
"More SQLs than MQLs" is not a rounding issue. It means your funnel definitions differ between systems, or leads are entering mid-funnel, or someone is double-counting. Finding those rows is often more valuable than the entire performance analysis that follows — and it is the finding your CMO will actually thank you for.
:::

## Part 2 — The funnel model (6 min)

:::lab Step 2 — A model your CMO can interrogate
```prompt
Produce `output/funnel-model.xlsx` from `campaign-clean.csv`, with four tabs:

Tab "Data" — the cleaned rows. Header frozen, currency formatted.

Tab "Funnel" — by channel and by month: spend, impressions, clicks, MQLs, SQLs, opportunities, and every conversion rate between adjacent stages. All as LIVE FORMULAS reading from Data, never pasted values.

Tab "Efficiency" — channels ranked by cost per opportunity, with cost per MQL and cost per SQL alongside. Add a column for the number of underlying rows, so it is obvious which rankings rest on three data points and which rest on three hundred.

Tab "Excluded" — every row not counted in the Funnel tab, with the reason and the total spend those rows represent.

EDGES. No hard-coded totals where a formula would do. Rows flagged as funnel impossibilities go in Excluded, not Funnel — and show their spend total separately so I know how much of the budget is unexplained. Never fabricate a value to complete a calculation.
```

- [ ] The spreadsheet opens and the formulas are live
- [ ] The Efficiency tab shows the sample size per row
- [ ] The Excluded tab shows how much spend is unexplained
:::

:::warning The sample-size column is not optional
"Channel X has the best cost per opportunity" is a very different statement when channel X produced two opportunities than when it produced two hundred. Without a sample-size column next to every ranking, you will recommend reallocating a budget on the basis of noise — confidently, in a deck, to your CMO.
:::

## Part 3 — The readout (7 min)

:::lab Step 3 — The document that survives scrutiny
```prompt
BACKGROUND. My CMO has 10 minutes, distrusts marketing numbers on principle, and will ask "how do you know that" about every claim. She wants a budget decision, not a dashboard tour.

RESULT. `output/campaign-readout.md`, two pages maximum:

1. HEADLINE — one sentence on what this quarter actually shows
2. THE NUMBERS — a compact table: spend, MQLs, SQLs, opportunities, cost per opportunity, and the same for the prior period if the data supports a comparison. If it does not, say so rather than comparing anyway
3. WHAT WORKED — two campaigns or channels, each with the specific numbers and the sample size behind the claim
4. WHAT DID NOT — two, same treatment, no hedging and no "learnings"
5. DATA INTEGRITY — what is wrong with this data, how much spend is affected, and what that does to the confidence in sections 3 and 4
6. THREE RECOMMENDATIONS — each with the number that justifies it, the amount of money involved, and what you would expect to happen
7. WHAT THIS DATA CANNOT TELL YOU — the honest limits. Attribution, view-through, brand effects, anything the tracking does not capture
8. WHAT I NEED — decisions or resources, stated as requests

INPUTS. `campaign-clean.csv`, `funnel-model.xlsx`, `data-integrity.md`.

EDGES. Every claim needs a number from the model, and every ranking claim needs its sample size stated. Never describe a difference as significant if the sample cannot support it — say "the sample is too small to call". Never present a cost-per-opportunity figure without noting the excluded spend. Two pages maximum.

FLAG: any recommendation where you are less than confident, and say why.
```

- [ ] Two pages
- [ ] Section 5 is specific about how much spend is affected
- [ ] Section 7 exists and is genuinely honest
- [ ] Every ranking claim states its sample size
:::

:::tip Section 7 is why she will believe sections 3 and 4
Counter-intuitive but reliable: **a readout that states its own limits is trusted more than one that does not.** A sceptical executive is looking for whether you know what you do not know. Section 7 answers that question before she has to ask it, and everything else in the document gets more credit as a result.
:::

## Part 4 — Verify

:::lab The verification pass
- [ ] Trace three numbers from the readout to the model, then to a source row
- [ ] Check the total spend in the readout against the total spend in the raw file — including excluded rows
- [ ] For every ranking claim, check the sample size yourself
- [ ] If you have CRM access, compare the opportunity count against the CRM's own number and find out why they differ
- [ ] Read section 7. Is anything missing that you know to be a limit of your tracking?
:::

:::warning The comparison that always disagrees
Marketing-sourced opportunity counts and CRM opportunity counts almost never match. Common causes: attribution windows, lead-to-opportunity conversion timing, opportunities created by sales without a marketing touch, and duplicate lead records.

Find out which of these explains your gap **before** you present. "Marketing says 40, the CRM says 27, and here is exactly why" is a strong position. Being asked and not knowing is not.
:::

## Part 5 — Make it a Monday job

This chain — integrity, model, readout — is a perfect scheduled task, because it is read-only and the inputs refresh on their own.

- [ ] Save all three briefs as a sequence
- [ ] Note your actual channel taxonomy and hard-code it, so it does not get re-derived each run
- [ ] Note your funnel stage definitions
- [ ] Module 7 puts this on a schedule and has it report its own failures

```quiz
Q: Why does every ranking claim need its sample size stated next to it?
- For completeness
+ Because "best cost per opportunity" from two opportunities and from two hundred are entirely different claims — and without the count you will reallocate budget on noise
- To make the table wider
- Because CMOs ask for it
> This is the single most common way a confident data readout misleads.

Q: A readout that includes "what this data cannot tell you" is…
- Weaker, because it undermines the analysis
+ More trusted, because a sceptical executive is checking whether you know what you do not know
- The same, but longer
- Only appropriate for internal use
> Stating your limits earns credit for everything else in the document.

Q: You find rows with more SQLs than MQLs. What does this most likely mean?
- A rounding error
+ Funnel definitions differ between systems, leads are entering mid-funnel, or something is double-counted — a real problem worth more than the performance analysis
- The data is fine
- The campaign over-performed
> Impossible funnel arithmetic is a definitional problem, and finding it is often the most valuable output of the run.

Q: Marketing reports 40 opportunities; the CRM says 27. What is the right move before presenting?
- Use the CRM number, it is authoritative
+ Find out exactly which of attribution windows, timing, sales-created opportunities or duplicates explains the gap
- Present both without comment
- Average them
> "Here is exactly why they differ" is a strong position. Being asked and not knowing is not.
